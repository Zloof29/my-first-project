Lior, your improvment is amazing, I see that you started to become a really good developer.
couple of things.
- The way that you stored that data:
You needed to store the data in one array that holdes multiple object.
your data suppose to look like this


let products = [{
    name: "mlik",
    price: 30,
    category: "dairy"
}, {
    name: "ANOTHER PRODUCT",
    price: 23,
    category: "dairy"
}]

anod not hout you stored it.

- You functions breakdown is amazing.
- You added an edit action that this is amazing.
- Your local storage was effected by your data structure.
- You used an iffi function amazing.

Good test, you will see your grade soon :)
